###Who am I?

My name is Sean Wallitsch. I'm an artist, a developer and a gamer.

I work in Visual Effects for feature films- explosions, spaceships, the like.

Over the years I've written tool packages, supervised production workflows, taken 360 degree HDRs, and led compositing teams.

I needed a place to post code snippets and describe workflows, and this is that place.
